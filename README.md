# Etc-a-Sketch

First I will create two nested loops to create my 16x16 grid
- we will create a "row" div that will contain all of the 16 divs inside them for every iteration of the loop (so it might feel like 17)
- 
Since they will appear blank, I will apply styling to them so I can visually see them in my screen.
